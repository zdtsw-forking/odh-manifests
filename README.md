## ODH Core Components

Open Data Hub is an end-to-end AI/ML platform on top of OpenShift Container Platform that provides a core set of integrated components to support end end-to-end MLOps workflow for Data Scientists and Engineers. The components currently available as part of the ODH Core deployment are:

* [ODH Dashboard](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard)
* [ODH Notebook Controller](odh-notebook-controller/README.md)
* [ODH Notebook Images](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/notebooks/blob/main/README.md)

  * [TrustyAI Explainability](https://github.com/trustyai-explainability)

## ODH Incubating Components

Any components that were removed with the update to ODH 1.4 have been relocated to the [ODH Contrib](https://github.com/opendatahub-io-contrib) organization under the [odh-contrib-manifests](https://github.com/opendatahub-io-contrib/odh-contrib-manifests) repo.  You can reference the [odh-contrib kfdef](kfdef/odh-contrib.yaml) as a reference on how to deploy any of the odh-contrib-manifests components
